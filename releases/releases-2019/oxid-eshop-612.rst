System requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OXID eShop 6.1.2 runs under PHP 7.0 and 7.1. PHP 5.6 is no longer supported. The supported database is MySQL version 5.5 or 5.7. Using MySQL 5.6 is not recommended as it could cause issues with Enterprise Edition. Please refer to the blog post: `Set MySQL 5.6 optimizer setting "block_nested_loop = off" for OXID eShop Enterprise Edition <https://oxidforge.org/en/set-mysql-5-6-optimizer-setting-block_nested_loop-off-for-oxid-eshop-enterprise-edition.html>`_. Apache 2.2 or 2.4 can be used as a web server on a Linux system.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please follow the instructions in section "Installation":

:doc:`New installation <../../installation/new-installation/new-installation>` |br|
:doc:`Installing updates <../../installation/installing-updates/installing-updates>`

Please run the update first in a test or development environment, or a copy of your current shop. Then, test the ordering process and payment and shipping methods. If the shop works correctly, you can replace the shop in the live system with the one from the test or development environment.
