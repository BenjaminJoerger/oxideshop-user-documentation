Main tab
========

The :guilabel:`Main` tab lists all information relevant to the wished price, such as the e-mail address, the name of the customer, the selected product, the wished price and the regular price. The editor also displays a ready-made text for the e-mail, which can be sent to the customer when the wished price is achieved. This text can be individually adapted for the customer. The text elements are defined in the language files of the administration panel (EMAIL_PRICEALARM_CUSTOMER_*).

Text of the notification e-mail
-------------------------------
The right side of the :guilabel:`trunk` tab is filled with an editor that works on the WYSIWYG principle (What You See Is What You Get). It therefore displays the text as it will appear later in the notification e-mail. The editor lets you use different text formatting options and insert links, pictures and videos. It also allows you to display and edit the HTML code to meet any special or additional requirements.

With the notification e-mail the customer is informed that his wished price has been achieved or even undercut. Its text can be adapted in content and individually formatted.
