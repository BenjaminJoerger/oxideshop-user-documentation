After ordering, the download links can be found under :menuselection:`Account --> My downloads`. The files can be downloaded once the payment has been made. If the order hasn’t yet been marked as paid, a corresponding message will be displayed. If the customer used direct debit as a payment method, he/she will be able to download the files immediately. The order confirmation e-mail will also contain the download links to the ordered files when the payment is complete.

All downloads belonging to the order will be displayed in a table.
